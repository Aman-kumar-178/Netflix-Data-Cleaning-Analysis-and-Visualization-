# 🎬 Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization  

## 📖 Overview  
The **Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization** project focuses on understanding Netflix’s content catalog through data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.  
By analyzing the trends in movies and TV shows, this project uncovers insights into **genre popularity**, **release year trends**, **ratings distribution**, and **country-wise content production**.  

The analysis uses Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to generate meaningful insights and interactive visualizations.  

---

## 🧠 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset (handle missing and duplicate values).  
- Perform detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
- Visualize data trends and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  
- Identify **top genres**, **most active production countries**, and **release year distributions**.  
- Derive insights about the **diversity and evolution** of Netflix’s content library.

## 📂 Dataset Information  
- **Dataset Name:** Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)  
- **Attributes include:**  
  - `show_id`, `type`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`,  
    `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in`, `description`

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation and cleaning  
  - `numpy` – for numerical operations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for data visualization  
  - `plotly` – for interactive dashboards  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- The majority of Netflix’s content consists of **Movies** rather than TV Shows.  
- **United States** and **India** contribute significantly to the content library.  
- **Dramas**, **Comedies**, and **Documentaries** are among the most common genres.  
- There is a strong growth in content after **2015**, showing Netflix’s global expansion.

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Loading** – Import dataset into Pandas DataFrame.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.  
3. **EDA & Visualization** – Explore data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
4. **Insight Generation** – Summarize findings and visualize key results.  
5. **Model (Optional)** – Create any recommendation logic or trend prediction model.

## 🧩 Model / Pickle File Integration  
If you have trained a machine learning model or created a custom logic stored as a `.pkl` file (e.g., recommendation system, trend predictor),  
you can attach it from Google Drive for others to load and use easily.
